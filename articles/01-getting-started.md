[Crosscheck Sports](https://crosschecksports.com) is a powerful application for managing sports teams. It takes the headache out of balancing excel spreadsheets, sending out reminder emails, making sure you have enough players for a game, etc.

This will serve as a basic guide on getting started using the app.

## Creating an Account

Whether you received an email to join a team or not, you will need to create an account to begin using Crosscheck Sports. We use the latest encryption technology to keep your data safe and never take any more information than we have to in order to run the application. 

### Login

If you already have an account you can click "Login". If you forgot your password, you can recreate it on the login page by selecting "Forgot password".

## Navigating the App

The app's main navigation is in the form of a tab bar. Depending on your current state, or whether you are part of a team and season, the app bar will have different icons present.

### Basic Tab Bar

If instead you have an app code, you can join the team on this screen as well, or you can follow the guide [here](/docs/join-team).
